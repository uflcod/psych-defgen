# Psychological Construct Definition Retrieval

Psychological Construct Definition Retrieval is a Python package for retrieving evidence-based definitions of psychological constructs from PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC) literature.

## Overview

The package implements a literature retrieval workflow that searches the biomedical literature for a target psychological construct, retrieves relevant PubMed abstracts and PubMed Central (PMC) full-text articles, identifies candidate definition statements, ranks evidence using semantic similarity, and selects the strongest explicit definition found in the retrieved literature.

The APA Dictionary of Psychology is used only to verify and reference existing dictionary entries. APA content is not used to identify definitions from the scientific literature.

## Workflow

## Features

- Search PubMed for articles related to a psychological construct.
- Retrieve full-text articles from PubMed Central (PMC), when available.
- Retrieve PubMed abstracts and examine them alongside available full-text articles.
- Extract explicit candidate definition statements from PMC full text and PubMed abstracts.
- Chunk and prepare retrieved evidence for semantic retrieval.
- Perform semantic retrieval using sentence-transformer embeddings.
- Rank evidence passages by semantic relevance.
- Select the strongest explicit definition found in the retrieved literature.
- Verify APA Dictionary entries and provide the official reference URL when available.
- Export the definition from literature and supporting evidence as Markdown.

# Configure NCBI Credentials

This package uses the NCBI Entrez API to retrieve PubMed and PubMed Central articles.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory:

```text
.env
```

Add your NCBI email address and optional NCBI API key:

```env
NCBI_EMAIL=YOUR_NCBI_EMAIL
NCBI_API_KEY=YOUR_NCBI_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_NCBI_EMAIL` with your email address and `YOUR_NCBI_API_KEY` with your NCBI API key.

The NCBI email address is required. The NCBI API key is optional but recommended for higher request rate limits.

The package does not store or transmit your email address or API key except when making requests to the official NCBI Entrez API. These credentials are used only to identify your requests in accordance with NCBI API guidelines.

Do not commit the `.env` file to the repository.

# Usage

Retrieve a definition for a psychological construct:

```bash
psych-defgen gerotranscendence
```

Multi-word constructs are supported:

```bash
psych-defgen "social isolation"
```

Specify the number of retrieved articles and evidence passages:

```bash
psych-defgen "social isolation" \
    --max-results 20 \
    --top-k 5
```

Specify a custom output file:

```bash
psych-defgen "social isolation" \
    --output results/social_isolation_definition.md
```

Options can be combined:

```bash
psych-defgen "social isolation" \
    --max-results 20 \
    --top-k 5 \
    --output results/social_isolation_definition.md
```

Display all available command-line options:

```bash
psych-defgen --help
```

# Output

By default, retrieved definitions and supporting evidence are saved as Markdown files in the `outputs` directory. A custom output file can be specified using the `--output` option.

```text
outputs/social_isolation_definition.md
```

The output filename is automatically created from the requested psychological construct.

# Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- Valid NCBI email address
- Chromium browser installed through Playwright

Install the required Playwright browser with

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

An NCBI API key is optional but recommended for higher request rate limits.
